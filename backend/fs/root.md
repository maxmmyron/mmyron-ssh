# hey, i'm max

I study computer science and philosophy at Suffolk University, and design and develop web tools in my spare time. I can't comment on their usefulness, but they're hopefully a little cool.

## Recent Projects

### Hypersearch

Hypersearch is a Chromium extension that provides power-user search tools. Slim down and streamline Google search result pages by filtering out spam results and blocking unnecessary info cards.

### asciish

Asciish is a Vite/Rollup extension that provides build-time Unicode injection using shortcodes. This helps to keep source code UTF-8 compliant while allowing for the use of complex Unicode characters on a webpage.

### escape-time

Escape time is a small WebGL fractal explorer thrown together over a weekend for a Suffolk University Math Society presentation. It supports a few different fractals and was mostly a WebGL learning experience.

### Clippy

Clippy.mov is a web-based video editor built using FFmpeg.wasm. I stopped developing it after the new school semester started, and recently came back to it. It's in active development.
